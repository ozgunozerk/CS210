    "A database about Taxi's in New York will be inspected in the scope of this project. First, information about the dataset itself will be given, such as descriptive statistics, datatypes, shapes, etc... After that, Some interesting information will be tried to be drived from the dataset, for example the most common districts for pickup/drop-off locations. And finally, 2 questions will be answered using the help of statistics:\n",
    "1. Does passenger group size affect the distance?\n",
    "2. Do trip distances increase in weekends?"
